h1.   Macronconversions

h2.  Who's This For?

If you work with a language that makes use of vowels that have quantity...

AND

you need to generate those macron-bearing characters based on ASCII standards (because character panel lookup is not awesome)

AND 

you work with this language from the CLI

THEN

Wow, there's someone else besides me?

*ahem*

THEN Macronconversions may be the library for you!

h2.  Macronconversions lets you convert easily between ASCII and funnt mulitbyte representations

bc.$ mconv -M  "laud\={a}re" 
laudāre

Coup-de-grâce

bc.$mdconv `mconv -M  "laud\={a}re" `
laud\={a}re

HTML codes instead

bc.$ mconv -H  "laud\={a}re" 
laud&#x101;re

h2.  Library

Obviously the bin/ files are just thin wrappers around the core library.  Consult the rdoc for programmatic use.

h2.  Install

    gem install macronconversions

h2. Current Status

Stable

h2.  Ridiculee-in-chief
