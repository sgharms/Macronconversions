h1.   Macronconversions

h2.  Who's This For?

If you work with a language that makes use of vowels that have quantity...

AND

you need to generate those macron-bearing characters based on ASCII standards (because character panel lookup is not awesome)

AND 

you work with this language from the CLI

THEN

Wow, there's someone else besides me?

*ahem*

THEN Macronconversions may be the library for you!

h2.  Macronconversions lets you convert easily between ASCII and funnt mulitbyte representations

<pre>
$ mconv -M  "laud\={a}re" 
laudāre
</pre>

Coup-de-grâce

<pre>
$mdconv `mconv -M  "laud\={a}re" `
laud\={a}re
</pre>

HTML codes instead

<pre>
$ mconv -H  "laud\={a}re" 
laud&#x101;re
</pre>

h2.  Library

Obviously the bin/ files are just thin wrappers around the core library.  Consult the RDoc for programmatic use.

h2.  Install

    gem install macronconversions

h2. Current Status

h2.  Horrible Typos

I'm currently relearning QWERTY from 10 years of Dvorak.  I should be getting better real soon now.
